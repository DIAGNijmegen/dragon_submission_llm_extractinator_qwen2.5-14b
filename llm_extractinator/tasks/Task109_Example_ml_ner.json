    "Task": "Multi-Label Binary Classification for Medical Texts",
    "Type": "Classification",
    "Description": "The task involves classifying the words of the text which specify the size of a lesion. The lesions are numbered with roman numerals. These numerals should be converted into integers starting from 0, so I = 0, II = 1, III = 2, IV = 3, etc. Create a list of lists where each inner list contains two entries: 1. The exact sequence of text that qualifies the lesion size (e.g. '19 mm' or '2 mm'). 2. The corresponding integer. It is possible for a measurement to be referenced by multiple lesions (e.g. I+II 19 mm). You should then write down separate entries (e.g. [19 mm, I],[19 mm, II]) If no entities are present in the text, return an empty list.",

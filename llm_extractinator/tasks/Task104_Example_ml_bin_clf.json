    "Description": "Given the following medical report text, determine a multi-label binary classification for lesions with physical size greater than 10 mm. If there is a lesion with size greater than 10 mm, the corresponding lesion field should be True; otherwise, it should be False. The report may contain up to five target lesions, each with a corresponding lesion field. If the size is not mentioned for a lesion, the corresponding lesion field should be False. It should specifically mention the word lesion and the size in millimeters for it to be considered.",

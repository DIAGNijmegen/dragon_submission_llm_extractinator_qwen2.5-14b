    "Type": "Multi Label Named Entity Recognition",
    "Description": "Your task is to analyze each word in a skin pathology report to classify and split the diagnosis for each specified case, numbered from 1 to 20. For each case, you should identify: 1) the case number as an integer, 2) the diagnosis, which can be \"BCC\", \"Benign\", or \"Other\", including the exact words from the text describing the diagnosis, 3) any subtypes present for cases diagnosed with basal cell carcinoma, including the exact words from the text describing the subtypes, and 4) the tissue acquisition method (either \"biopt\" or \"excision\"), including the exact words from the text describing the method. The output should be a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary containing the details for one case. Ensure all classifications and text references are accurate and derived directly from the input. Example Output Format: [{{\"case_number\": 1, \"diagnosis\": {{\"type\": \"BCC\", \"text\": \"basal cell carcinoma\"}}, \"subtypes\": [{{\"type\": \"nodular\", \"text\": \"nodular\"}}, {{\"type\": \"infiltrative\", \"text\": \"infiltrative\"}}], \"tissue_acquisition_method\": {{\"type\": \"biopt\", \"text\": \"biopt\"}}}}, {{\"case_number\": 2, \"diagnosis\": {{\"type\": \"Benign\", \"text\": \"benign nevus\"}}, \"subtypes\": [], \"tissue_acquisition_method\": {{\"type\": \"excision\", \"text\": \"excision\"}}}}]. By adhering to these instructions, you will deliver a structured and detailed analysis of each case in the pathology report, ensuring the exact words from the text are captured for each category.",

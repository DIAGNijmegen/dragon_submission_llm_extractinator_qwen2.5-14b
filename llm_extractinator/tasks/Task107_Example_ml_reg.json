    "Description": "Given the following medical report text, identify the sizes of up to 5 lesions mentioned in the report in millimeters. Use Roman numerals (I, II, III, IV, V) in the text to determine the order of the lesions. If a lesion is not present, output 0.0 for its size. Round the sizes to the nearest whole number.",

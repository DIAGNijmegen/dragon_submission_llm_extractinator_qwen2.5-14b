    "Task": "Prostate specific antigen density extraction",
    "Type": "Regression",
    "Description": "This task involves predicting the PSA density, which is either directly described in the radiology report or needs to be calculated based on the provided PSA level and prostate volume. The PSA density is related to the PSA and prostate volume as: PSA density = PSA / prostate volume.",

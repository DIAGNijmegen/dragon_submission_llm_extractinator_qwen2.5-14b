    "Task": "Pulmonary nodule size measurement",
    "Type": "Regression",
    "Description": "This task involves estimating the diameter of the largest pulmonary nodule described in the radiology report, with the diameter given in millimeters. When multiple sizes are described for a single lesion (e.g., the short and long axis), the size for that lesion should be averaged (e.g., 9 mm for a lesion of size 1.0 x 0.8 cm).",
